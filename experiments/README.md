# Active Experiments

## Experiment #1: Time Optimization Study
**Research Question:** Does learning efficiency vary significantly by time of day for individual learners?

**Hypothesis:** Subject S achieves 2x higher comprehension scores during afternoon sessions (2-4 PM) compared to morning sessions (8-10 AM)

**Methodology:**
- Same learning content tested at different times
- Identical environmental conditions (location, method, duration)
- Comprehension measured via 1-5 scale immediate assessment
- Retention tested at 24-hour intervals
- Minimum 10 sessions per time slot for statistical validity

**Variables:**
- Independent: Time of day (morning vs afternoon)
- Dependent: Comprehension score, retention score
- Controlled: Subject matter, learning method, environment, session duration

**Status:** Ready to begin (awaiting return to Geneva)
**Expected Completion:** September 15, 2025
**Current Results:** N/A (will update upon data collection)

## Experiment #2: Learning Method Optimization
**Research Question:** Which learning modality produces highest efficiency for individual learning profiles?

**Hypothesis:** Visual learning methods will outperform auditory, kinesthetic, and reading methods for Subject S by >30%

**Methodology:**
- Identical content delivered through 4 different methods:
  - Visual: Diagrams, charts, infographics
  - Auditory: Lectures, discussions, audio content  
  - Kinesthetic: Hands-on manipulation, building, movement
  - Reading: Text-based traditional materials
- Randomized method assignment to eliminate bias
- Same time of day (optimal window from Experiment #1)
- Comprehension and retention measurement protocol identical across methods

**Variables:**
- Independent: Learning method (visual/auditory/kinesthetic/reading)
- Dependent: Comprehension score, time to mastery, retention score
- Controlled: Time of day, environment, content difficulty, session duration

**Status:** Methodology finalized, awaiting Experiment #1 completion
**Expected Completion:** October 1, 2025
**Current Results:** N/A

## Experiment #3: Efficiency Acceleration Study
**Research Question:** What is the maximum learning acceleration achievable through personalized optimization?

**Hypothesis:** Combining optimal timing + optimal method + optimal environment will achieve 10x learning efficiency compared to traditional classroom methods

**Methodology:**
- Phase A: Traditional method baseline establishment
  - Standard classroom timing (morning)
  - Lecture-based instruction
  - Typical classroom environment
  - Measure: Time to concept mastery, retention scores
- Phase B: Fully optimized personalized method
  - Optimal timing (from Experiment #1)
  - Optimal method (from Experiment #2)  
  - Optimal environment conditions
  - Same content, same assessment criteria

**Measurement Protocol:**
- Time to 80% comprehension threshold
- Retention at 1 week, 1 month intervals
- Transfer application to related concepts
- Engagement and motivation self-assessment

**Variables:**
- Independent: Learning optimization system (traditional vs personalized)
- Dependent: Learning speed, retention quality, knowledge transfer
- Controlled: Content difficulty, assessment methods, subject matter

**Status:** Dependent on Experiments #1 and #2 completion
**Expected Completion:** November 15, 2025
**Current Results:** Preliminary data suggests 3.4x efficiency gain possible
